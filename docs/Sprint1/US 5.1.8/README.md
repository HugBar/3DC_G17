# User Story 5.1.8: Create Patient Profile (Admin)

## Description
As an Admin, I want to create a new patient profile, so that I can register their personal details and medical history.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admins can input patient details such as first name, last name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.
2. A unique patient ID (Medical Record Number) is generated upon profile creation.
3. The system validates that the patientâ€™s email and phone number are unique.
4. The profile is stored securely in the system, and access is governed by role-based permissions.

## Implementation Details

### Controller: PatientController
- Located in `Controllers/PatientController.cs`
- Handles HTTP requests for patient creation
- Endpoints:
  - POST `/api/patient`: Creates new patient profile
  - Requires admin role authorization

### Service: PatientService
- Located in `Domain/Patient/PatientService.cs`
- Implements business logic for patient creation
- Key methods:
  - `CreatePatientAsync`: Processes new patient creation
  - `GenerateUniqueMRN`: Creates Medical Record Number
  - `ValidatePatientData`: Ensures data integrity

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- `CreatePatientDto`: Contains patient creation data
  - Personal information
  - Contact details
  - Medical history
  - Emergency contacts
- `PatientDto`: Returns created patient data

### Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Admin role verification
- Input validation
- Data encryption
- HIPAA compliance measures

### Email Service
- Interface: `Domain/Shared/IEmailService.cs`
- Implementation: `Infrastructure/SmtpEmailService.cs`
- Handles:
  - Welcome emails
  - Verification messages
  - Profile confirmations

### Logging Service
- Interface: `Domain/Shared/ILoggingService.cs`
- Implementation: `Infrastructure/LoggingService.cs`
- Logs:
  - Profile creation
  - Admin actions
  - Validation events
  - Email notifications

## Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram (`docs/Sprint1/US 5.1.8/02.design/puml/sequenceDiagram.puml`) illustrates:
1. Admin initiates patient creation
2. System validates admin privileges
3. Data validation process
4. MRN generation
5. Profile creation completion

## Class Diagram
The class diagram (`docs/Sprint1/US 5.1.8/02.design/puml/class_diagram.puml`) shows relationships between:
- PatientController
- PatientService
- IPatientRepository
- IEmailService
- CreatePatientDto
- PatientDto

## Testing
- Unit tests in `Tests/Unit/Controllers/PatientControllerTests.cs`
- Unit tests in `Tests/Unit/Domain/PatientServiceTests.cs`
- Tests cover:
  - Admin authorization
  - Data validation
  - MRN generation
  - Profile creation
  - Email notifications

## Future Improvements
1. Profile Creation

   - Real-time validation
   - Quick duplicate checking
   - Smart data suggestions
   - Mobile-friendly interface

3. Integration
   - External system connectivity
